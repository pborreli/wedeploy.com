##### 7. Non-Compliance.
Customer will immediately notify Liferay if Customer suspects someone has breached this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, or has obtained unauthorized access to Customer’s Account, the Content and/or the Services.

Customer will not interfere with Liferay’s monitoring activities and will provide Content or other information regarding Customer’s Account and/or Content as may be reasonably requested by Liferay to ensure that Customer’s use of the Services complies with this Agreement. Liferay reserves the right (but has no obligation) to suspend or terminate Customer’s access to the Services or disable Customer’s Account or remove Customer’s or Customer’s Users' Content if Liferay, in its sole discretion, believes Customer or Customer’s User has breached the terms of the Agreement, any policy referred in this Agreement or has violated any applicable law.

**9.1  Technical Support.** The Services are provided for Customer’s use and evaluation without any technical support and may include beta or developer preview services.

Liferay will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of material changes to the Services on the applicable Services website.


##### 11. Fees
**11.1 Fees, Units.** Certain Services may be offered at no charge. For Services offered for a fee Customer agrees to pay Liferay (or a Business Partner see Section 11.6 below) any applicable Fees to receive the Services and for all usage by Customer or Customer’s Users. The Fees will be based on and Customer’s use of the Services will be limited to a certain amount of Units. For details on the various Service offerings please refer to [www.wedeploy.com](https://wedeploy.com). From time to time, Liferay may offer Customer certain promotional pricing or promotional services, including but not limited to developer previews or betas (“**Promotional Services**”), during a specific term ("**Promotional Period**"). Customer’s use of the Promotional Services during any such Promotional Period will be limited to the term of the Promotional Period and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as well as any additional terms and conditions that Liferay may provide in connection with the Promotional Period such as usage limitations, quotas, term limits and limited or no support. If Customer requires Services in excess of any Unit thresholds associated with the Service that the Customer has purchased, Customer must purchase the appropriate Services and pay any associated Fees to cover the utilized Units from the date Customer first utilized such Units. All Fees are nonrefundable.

**11.2 Credit Card Processing.** For any Services purchased through the WeDeploy portal, Customer must first provide Liferay and/or its third party payment processor with a valid and authorized credit or debit card number and associated charge information prior to receiving Services and Customer (i) authorizes Liferay or its third party payment processor to charge Customer’s credit card for any Fees, and for the amount due at the time of renewal of the Services, and (ii) if needed, agrees to provide updated credit card information to Liferay and/or its third party payment processor for subsequent Fees due. In order to provide the Services, Liferay may be required to share Customer’s information, including credit/debit card and other financial information, with third parties solely for the purpose of processing payment and/or providing the Services.

**11.3 Order Form.** If Customer is purchasing the Services from Liferay other than through the WeDeploy portal, the following terms will apply. Fees will be identified in an ordering document ("**Order Form**") and are (a) due upon Liferay's acceptance of an Order Form or, for renewal of Services, at the start of the renewal term, and (b) payable in accordance with this section. If credit terms are provided to Customer, Liferay will invoice Customer for the Fees upon Liferay's acceptance of the applicable Order Form and upon acceptance of any future order. Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form and subject to Liferay's approval of credit terms, Customer will pay Fees, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of each invoice. Liferay reserves the right to suspend or cancel performance of all or part of the Services and/or change its credit terms if actual payment has not been received within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Customer may be charged interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.

**11.4  Taxes, Transaction Fees.** All Fees are exclusive of Taxes and Transaction Fees. Customer will pay Liferay an amount equal to any Taxes and Transaction Fees arising from or relating to this Agreement which are paid by or are payable by Liferay. "**Taxes**" means any form of sales, use, value added or other form of taxation and any fines, penalties, surcharges or interest, but excluding any taxes based solely on the net income of Liferay. “**Transaction Fees**” means currency conversion fees, wire transfer fees or other bank payment charges. If Customer is required to pay, withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to Liferay, Customer will increase the sum payable to Liferay by the amount necessary so that Liferay receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had Customer made no withholdings or deductions and to offset any Transaction Fees, so that Liferay ultimately receives an amount equal to the full amount of Fees as invoiced.

**11.5  Future Availability.** Customer acknowledges that Customer’s purchase of the Services is not contingent on the future availability of any new features or functionality. From time to time Liferay may in its sole discretion increase or decrease the levels of the Services and modify any Fees, provided that such change or modification will only become effective upon the first renewal following thirty (30) days prior notice to Customer.

**11.6  Business Partners.** When Customer orders Services through a Business Partner, Liferay confirms that Liferay is responsible for providing the Services to Customer under the terms of this Agreement. However, Liferay is not responsible and shall not be liable for (i) the actions or omissions of Business Partners, (ii) any additional obligations not set out in this Agreement and which the Business Partners may have agreed to provide to the Customer, and/or (iii) any products or services that Business Partners supply to Customer under any separate agreements between a Business Partner and Customer. If Customer is purchasing Services from a Business Partner the terms included in Sections 11.2 and 11.3 above do not apply. “**Business Partner**” means an organization authorized by Liferay, directly or indirectly, to promote, market, sell, resell, distribute and support Services. Business Partners may for example include (without limitation) distributors, resellers or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For the avoidance of doubt, “Business Partner” does not mean subcontractors with whom Liferay has entered into an agreement to perform one or more of the Services offered under this Agreement.

**12.3 Termination of the Services.** Customer may stop using the Services or may terminate Customer’s Account at any time, subject to the terms below. Liferay may discontinue Promotional Services at any time upon notice to Customer. All Fees are non-refundable even if Customer terminates the Services prior to the end of the month and Customer will be responsible for any Fees incurred prior to termination. Liferay may, at its discretion terminate Customer’s Account and remove Customer’s Content if Customer’s Account has been inactive for more than fifteen (15) days.

**12.4 Termination of the Agreement.** Liferay may terminate the Agreement in its sole discretion on thirty (30) days prior notice; provided that if Customer has pre-paid for Services beyond such thirty (30) day period, Liferay may provide Customer either, at its sole discretion, a pro rata refund of pre-paid Fees or the ability to continue to use the Services for such pre-paid period. Either Party may terminate the Agreement for material breach by the other Party of this Agreement, if the breach is not remedied within twenty (20) days of receiving notice of such breach. Without limiting other rights that Liferay may have, Liferay may suspend or terminate Customer’s Services, and Customer’s Account or disable Customer’s or Customer’s User's Content immediately if Liferay reasonably believes Customer or Customer’s Users have breached this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy or applicable law.

**12.5  Effect of Termination.** Upon termination of the Agreement, Customer will be required to pay any outstanding Fees that are due, all rights under this Agreement will cease and Customer may no longer use the Services. If Customer terminates the Services, Customer is responsible for: (i) removing any Content from Customer’s Account and (ii) following any additional steps provided to Customer in connection with the termination.

Following termination of Customer’s Account, Customer will no longer have access to the Services, or any Content stored in connection with the Services.

THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS CONTAINED IN SECTIONS 13 AND 14 APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY (INCLUDING ANY LIMITED OR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY) PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.


##### 15. Indemnification
Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Liferay, its Affiliates and their licensors and vendors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and associated litigation expenses) arising out of or relating to: (a) Customer’s use and/or Customer’s Users' use of the Services; (b) Customer’s breach of this Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policy, or violation of applicable law by Customer and/or Customer’s Users; (c) Content or the combination of Content with other applications, content or processes, (d) any claim or allegation that Content infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of any third party; (e) Liferay’s response to any third party subpoena, warrant, audit, agency action or other legal order or process concerning Content, Customer’s Account and/or use by Customer and/or Customer’s Users of the Services or (f) any dispute between Customer and a Third Party Software or Service provider or Customer and Customer’s User. Liferay will provide Customer with written notice of any claim, suit or action, but its failure to do so does not relieve Customer of its obligations under this section.


##### 16. Confidentiality
**16.1  Confidentiality Obligations.** Liferay and Customer agree that during the term of this Agreement, as a condition to the receipt of Confidential Information hereunder, Recipient shall: (i) except as expressly permitted by this Agreement not disclose, directly or indirectly, to any third party any portion of the Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party; (ii) not use or exploit the Confidential Information except for the provision of Services; (iii) upon the Disclosing Party’s written request promptly return or destroy, at Recipient’s option, all materials and documentation regarding the Confidential Information received hereunder save for (a) Confidential Information stored in routine back-up media not accessible during the ordinary course of business and (b) archival copies of the Confidential Information that the Recipient needs to maintain in order to comply with statutory or regulatory requirements, unless otherwise prohibited by law, provided that in both cases (a) and (b) the Confidential Information shall remain subject to this Agreement; and (iv) exercise at least the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as Recipient would with its own confidential information, provided that at a minimum, the Recipient must use reasonable care to protect the information. Both parties agree that obligations of confidentiality will exist for a period of two (2) years following initial disclosure of the particular Confidential Information unless terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 16 or in writing by the Disclosing Party; provided that, to the extent the Confidential Information is subject to longer confidentiality terms under mandatory applicable law (e.g., trade secrets), the Recipient will protect such Confidential Information as required by such law.

**16.2  Permitted Disclosures.** The parties may disclose Confidential Information only to those employees, Affiliates, agents, representatives and contractors who have a "need to know" such information in order to undertake their work with respect to this Agreement or otherwise to the benefit of the parties and to its auditors and legal counsel, in each case, who are under a written obligation or otherwise obligated by law to keep such information confidential using standards of confidentiality not less restrictive than those required by this Agreement. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information, if it is required to do so by applicable law, court order, or regulation, any governmental or other regulatory authority. Before disclosing such information, Recipient will notify Disclosing Party of the disclosure requirement (if it can provide notice without breaching any legal or regulatory requirement or court order) and cooperate with Disclosing Party (at the Disclosing Party’s expense) to obtain a protective order or other similar protection. If Recipient is required by law, statute, regulation or court order to make such a disclosure Recipient shall furnish only the portion of the Confidential Information that Recipient, in the opinion of its legal counsel, is legally required to disclose and shall exercise reasonable efforts to preserve for the remainder the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

**16.3  Equitable Relief.** Each party acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of Confidential Information, any breach of the obligations of this Section 16 may cause the non-breaching party irreparable harm for which an adequate remedy at law may not be available and that, therefore, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable remedies including temporary restraining order(s) or preliminary or permanent injunction relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to stop or prevent any breach of this Section 16, in addition to all other remedies available at law.


##### 17. Publicity and Benchmarking. 
Customer may not misrepresent Customer’s relationship with Liferay nor suggest or publish that Liferay or any of its affiliates or licensors endorses, sponsors, contributes to or provides support for Content. Customer may not publish the results of any benchmarking studies that Customer conduct in connection with the Services or publish any press releases regarding Customer’s use of the Services unless Customer obtains Liferay's prior written approval.


##### 18. Data
**18.1 Consent.** Customer acknowledges and agrees that to provide the Services it may be necessary for Content or other information to be transferred between Liferay, its Affiliates, vendors and/or subcontractors, which may be located worldwide. Customer agrees that Liferay, its Affiliates and/or subcontractors are acting as data processors on Customer’s behalf, and Customer appoints Liferay to process Customer’s Content in order to provide the Services to Customer. Customer will obtain any necessary consent from Customer’s Users whose Personally Identifiable Information (defined below) or other Content Customer will be hosting in Services.

**18.2  Safeguards and Privacy Policy.** Customer agrees to use reasonable security precautions in light of Customer’s use of the Services, including encrypting Personally Identifiable Information transmitted to and from, and while stored on, the Services. In addition, Customer acknowledges that Customer is solely responsible for taking steps to maintain appropriate security, protection and backup of Content. Liferay makes no representation regarding the security of the Services or Customer’s Content. In the event of unauthorized access to Content, Customer is responsible for complying with any applicable laws and regulations, including, for example, those that require notification of individuals whose Personally Identifiable Information may have been compromised. If Customer creates a Project for Customers, Customer agrees to protect the privacy of Customer’s Users' data, including implementing a privacy policy that complies with applicable law (and at minimum contains terms substantially similar to those in the Privacy Policy) and notifying Customer’s Users that their data will be stored on facilities accessible to Liferay, its Affiliates, vendors and/or subcontractors.

**18.3  Legal Process.** Liferay may provide information, including Content and information concerning Customer’s Account, as required by law (such as responding to a subpoena, warrant, audit, or agency action, or to prevent fraud) or to establish or exercise its legal rights or to defend against legal claims. Liferay shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information to such third parties.


##### 19. Governing Law; Jurisdiction
The validity, interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement (and any dispute or claim relating to it, or its formation, existence, construction, performance or termination) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and of the State of California without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its subject matter will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction located in Los Angeles County, California and each party irrevocably consents to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this venue. In the event the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any similar federal or state laws or regulations are enacted, it will not apply to this Agreement, and the governing law will remain as if such law or regulation had not been enacted.
